#Portfolio

###Welcome to my portfolio repo.

Here is an on-going collection of non-production code meant to track my growth as a coder. I started coding during the Summer of 2013 through Codecademy lessons. Soon after, started editing websites for friends and their entrepreneurial efforts. I started with HTML/CSS and grew into Python and JavaScript. Graduate school had me programming in C++ and my work in web development requires Node.js.

I currently have been tinkering with Arduino projects with the help of Alan G. Smith's [Intro to Arduino] (http://www.princeton.edu/~ffab/media___downloads_files/IntroArduinoBook.pdf).

###Notes

All scripts in this repo should be ready to run or compile. Projects requiring a framework, especially those in the Node folder are exceptions.
